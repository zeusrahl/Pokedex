# EDK's Pokèdex
This is the beginning of my Pokèdex project. I anticipate that I will be able to learn how to adapt this for various different projects as it is about creating the JavaScript and calling an API. Building the API will be an enjoyable activity as well I do now know a lot about Pokèmon, so I wouldn't be able to adapt the API for myself. But I already have ideas on how to adapt this for D&D 5e.
### Lesson 1.2
In this assignment, they wanted me to start my `README.md` so that I can start to document my progress. In this assignment, we looked at some of the different variable types, both **primitive** and **complex**.
### Lesson 1.3
I worked on presenting the pokèmon I added to my list. I also added a header, picking the pokèmon yellow as the banner color, and a common black color for the lettering.
I will be working on ideas for making the project look nicer.
